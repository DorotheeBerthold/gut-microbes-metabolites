# Integration of metabolomics data and 16S data

This repository encompasses the analysis of a publicly available dataset collecting 16S data and metabolites along the gastrointestinal tract of SPF and GF mice [Meier et al., *Nature Metabolism*, 2023](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-023-00802-1).

Package dependencies can be found [here](R/gutPackages.R) and thank you to the authors of these!

Some of the functions include:

- data cleanup for metadata integration
- calculation of fold-changes between SPF and GF mice at the different locations
- correlation heatmap for metabolite-microbe co-occurrences
- alpha diversity calculation of microbes at the different locations
